Salby was targeted by Macquarie Uni in Sydney for not toeing the line on the climate alarm.  Large government funds flow to Macquarie to 'investigate' the climate 'problem' supposedly caused by our CO2.

After being black-balled for over 3 years on the non-appearance of his promised resources, Salby was then instructed to perform menial tasks far below his level of competence - marking undergraduate student papers.

Soon after giving this talk in Hamburg, Salby was fired by email and his return ticket to Australia was cancelled, stranding him in Europe.

7:54 - "Temperature and CO2 evolve coherently, and nearly in-phase.  These changes refer to proxy CO2, in ice -- not atmospheric CO2 actually observed.  We need to understand how the two are related."

59:50 - "The simulated relationship [between CO2 and temperature] is remarkable.  Here's why: Remember the global energy budget?  It is what determines global temperature.  The increased CO2 contributes to the energy budget, but only at the 1% level.  The 1:1 correspondence indicates that changes in global temperature remain in equilibrium with changes in CO2, but nothing else.  Dominant contributions ..."
