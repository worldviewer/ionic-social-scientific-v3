Space was initially assumed to be a vacuum; but in the late 50's, with the advent of rockets, it could no longer be denied that charged particles were zipping around.

In the 40's, when radio engineers first spotted the radio waves which astronomers never thought to look for, the astronomers responded that it had to be a hoax or a mistake. Radio astronomy would not be recognized as an actual discipline until the late 50's.

The observation of large-scale magnetic fields associated with objects as large as galaxies to this day evokes speculative, metaphysical causes amongst theorists who were taught in high school that they tend to go hand-in-hand with electric currents.

We did not definitively understand that filaments are ubiquitous in the universe until the launch of Herschel in 2009. That was in fact one of Hannes Alfven's predictions for a plasma universe.

Most of the EM spectrum was unavailable to us up until the mid-1970's.

The term "plasma" was coined right around the time that the Big Bang was hypothesized (in the early 30's), but the concept of a "Plasma Universe" was not proposed until the mid-1980's.

The Big Bang theory had a half-century head-start on the Plasma Universe, but all of the most important discoveries over the past half-century have related to electromagnetism and plasmas. 

What is confusing people is that these recent discoveries were all made through the lens of that former worldview. So, it is not a surprise that scientists conjure up dark matter, but for those who are paying attention to the chronology here, the writing is on the wall that there is no dark matter. All of the recent observations are in fact pointing to plasmas.
